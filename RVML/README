RVML (Regressive Virtual Metric Learning)
=========================================

Python implementation of RVML presented in NIPS 2015:

Regressive Virtual Metric Learning,
MichaÃ«l Perrot and Amaury Habrard, NIPS 2015.

Features
--------

We provide here a python implementation of RVML (for both linear and kernelized cases) along with utilities functions used to compute Virtual Points (for both class based and Optimal Transport based approaches).

Dependencies 
------------

- Python 3.4 with numpy (best compiled against an optimized BLAS library), scipy, sklearn

- Optimal Transport Toolbox freely avaible on Remi Flamary's website (included, requires cvxpy and matplotlib)
Optimal Transport for Domain Adaptation
N. Courty, R. Flamary, D. Tuia, and A. Rakotomamonjy

Installation
------------

Once the dependencies are met, you can run example.py to have a basic example on the splice dataset.
